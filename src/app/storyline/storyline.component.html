    <h3>Crypto Collapse: The Last Transaction</h3>
    <p><strong>Year: 2248</strong> – Humanity is on the brink of collapse.</p><br>
    <p>After years of relentless "optimization" imposed by the Trusk Governance, a global megacorporation-turned-government, the world order crumbled. Their strict guidelines, known as the "Efficiency Rules", introduced practical yet ruthless measures such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rule #1:</strong> The Slower You Are, The Faster You're Fired.</li>
        <li><strong>Rule #2:</strong> Assets Must Flow – Hoarding Is Inefficient.</li>
        <li><strong>Rule #3:</strong> Emotions Are Costs. Cut Them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, it was the infamous slogan <strong>"You're Fired!"</strong> that delivered the final blow. What once was a humorous phrase became a brutal reality: entire populations were "terminated" – from jobs, cities, and ultimately, life itself.</p>
    <p>The XXIV World War, officially referred to as "The Great Efficiency War", led to the complete collapse of financial systems. Cash? Gone. Bank accounts? Inaccessible.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>What remained? Cryptocurrencies.</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>But even crypto has its limits now: The only way to store wealth is through hardware wallets that can hold a maximum of 100 coins. Anything beyond that is deemed inefficient and automatically erased by the system.</p>
    <h3>The Three Factions</h3>
    <p>Three powerful factions survived the war and now battle for control over the last digital assets:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="class-sepcial"> Bot Network</span><br> "If You're Not Automated, You're Outdated."<br> An autonomous AI network that views any human decision as inefficient. Their ultimate goal? A world governed entirely by algorithms.</li>
        <li><span class="class-sepcial">Donald Musk Holding</span><br> "Innovation or Termination."<br> A ruthless capitalist empire that exploits every opportunity for monetization. Their motto: Everything is a business – including human lives.</li>
        <li><span class="class-sepcial">Bureaucracy Empire</span><br> "Efficiency Through Endless Forms."<br> In this faction, every action requires permits and forms. Every transaction, every movement – meticulously documented. Fail to file your paperwork on time? You're erased.</li>
        <!-- <li><strong>African Cyborg League</strong><br> "Adapt to Survive. Upgrade to Win."<br> A technological rebellion that merges humans with machines. They believe the only way to survive in a world obsessed with efficiency is to overcome biological limitations.</li> -->
    </ul>
    <h3>Your Mission</h3>
    <p>In this post-apocalyptic world, you take on the role of a <strong>"Ledger Runner"</strong> – a mercenary operating in the shadows, scraping together the last remaining coins. Your task is to navigate through the shattered remnants of civilization and decide:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Will you support one of the factions?</li>
        <li>Or will you become the last independent trader in a world where every cent counts?</li>
    </ul>
